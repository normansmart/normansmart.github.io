                    <h1> Hello</h1>

                    <p> I'm a user experience designer looking to advance my career in the
                        design world.
                        <br>
                        I've always had a soft spot for art and design. It's where my talent blooms.
                        I can create and reform anything I can see.
                        <br>
                        I started out at Rutgers University as a Mechanical Engineer but towards my junior year user
                        experience piqued my interest and I switched to Computer Science.
                        <br>
                        Through years of study and practice, I've built the drive to build
                        engaging
                        design experiences for everyday people.
                        <br> <br>
                        I've also developed a peeve for badly designed tech...

                    I was born in the Enfield district of London, United Kingdo where I lived for 2 years before moving
                    back to my home country where I was raised.
                    <br> <br>
                    I spent 12 years in Lagos, Nigeria with my family. Ocassionally visiting our village in Umunachi,
                    Anambra State and London every year
                    and in February 2010, moved to Clifton, New Jersey at age 14 and have been here since.

                <p> I like a good read. fiction and non-fiction alike. In my learning experience,
                    I've found great read like The design of everyday things and my oersonal favorite: Thinkertoys
                    <br> Nothing beats Attack on Titan though. </p>

                <p> Terrible sense of smell, great sense of hearing so a good tune goes a long way with me.
                    Hip-hop, Rock, Alternative and the occasional orchestral score. If I'm not listening I'm making
                    scores. Take a listen. </p>
