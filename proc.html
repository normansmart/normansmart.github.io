                    <h2> BACKGROUND</h2>
                    <p> With the turn of a new year many Americans have goals they wish to attain.
                        Unfortunately, the grand majority do not see those goals through to fruition.
                        There are many programs, apps and services geared towards these purposes but many of them focus
                        on one particular discipline.
                        <br> <br>
                        Many Americans have high expectations for what z they want to achieve in the eve of any upcoming
                        new year.
                        However, the grand majority fall short of achieving said goals.
                        According to US news- 80% of Americans surveyed fail within 30 days with only 8% accomplishing
                        them.
                        The majority quitting by the second week of February.
                        <br> <br>
                        It’s no question, self-improvement is a highly desired thing among people in general.
                        Who doesn’t want to lose weight, be more physically active? That’s the obvious.
                        However, people quit. Also obvious. What’s not immediately obvious is why.
                    </p>
                </div>




            </div>




            <main>
                <section id="section-1">
                    <!-- set this to section and each section has an individual number that the links will be based on. When the link is clicked it scrolls to the given section-->

                    <h2> CHALLENGE </h2>

                    <p> Understanding why people give up on self-improvement boiled down simply to “life happens”.
                        People go to work, school, daycare, bars, get togethers, vacations.
                        With the daily hustle and bustle people do not think they have the time or leeway to practice
                        such self-care.
                        <br> <br>
                        As I mentioned, there are many apps and services marketed for these purposes but people either
                        do not utilize them or they stop using them.
                        These services are not engaging enough to users who are prone to dropping their self-improvement
                        desires.
                    </p>
                    <h3> SOLUTION </h3>
                    <p>
                        Because users essentially let go of their goals, they need a detail-oriented service made to
                        track and measure their progress towards that goal.
                        People want to lose weight; they don’t mind doing the work if they could understand how much it
                        will take and be able to see how far they have come.
                        So, I decided to design a product to suit that purpose. Measure and track.
                    </p>

                    <h3> GOALS </h3>
                    <p>
                        1) Clean and comfortable design to balance aesthetic and functionality
                        <br>
                        2) Detail oriented tool to keep users engaged with self-improvement progress
                        <br>
                        3) Improve the user experience for everyday average people
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I focused on the 3 most desired resolutions as a base for what users generally want for their
                        self-improvement. YouGov Data Journalist Jamie Ballard reports in her article Exercising more
                        and saving money are the most popular 2020 New Year’s Resolutions: “According to a survey
                        conducted in December 2019, nearly three in 10 (28%) Americans said that they plan to make New
                        Year’s resolutions for 2020.
                        <br> <br>
                        Among Americans who are making New Year’s resolutions, the most common ones are exercising more
                        (50%), saving money (49%), eating more healthily (43%), and losing weight (37%).”
                        <br> <br>
                        Fitness, dieting, and financial stability are the most desired resolutions among majority of the
                        Americans polled and I would say the majority of Americans as a whole.
                        <br> <br>
                        I broke the app into 3 main components to focus on this.
                    </p>


                </section>


                <section id="section-2">

                    <h2> DEVELOPMENT </h2>
                    <p> I researched into the necessities of a proper self-care app and conducted competitive research
                        into other services that already handle these things.
                        Many of these apps have add ons that are never used. My goal was not to overwhelm the user with
                        features and add ons, but to single out the few important things that are generally used and
                        streamline that content to be more digestible and useful.

                        <br>
                        I created 3 main categories with a limited list of sub categories.
                        <img class="display-image" src="images/ux/proc/breakdown.png">
                    </p>

                    <h3> USER FLOW</h3>

                    <img class="nav-image" src="images/ux/proc/app structure.png">


                    <h3> STRUCTURE</h3>

                    <p> The 3 categories work independently of each other so a basic navigation structure was most
                        appropriate, allowing users to seamlessly switch between categories to view information.
                        <br>
                        I found most self-care applications to focus largely on physical activity, for example, as the
                        focal point
                        with a graph of movement and other activity.
                        It places all service options on one page but gives the
                        most engagement towards step count.
                        <br>
                        While this is important, there many other features that are not given the same focus. I
                        concluded that each sub-category having its own dedicated measurement chart would prove most
                        useful.
                    </p>

                    <p> I reworked the design from the beginning and remoddled charts to be included in each sub
                        category. </p>
                    <br> <br>

                    <img class="measurement-image-2" src="images/ux/proc/measurement image 2.png">


                    <br> <br>
                    <p> I began sketching out the app structure based on the desired specifications and information I
                        gained through my observations and research.</p>

                    <h2> DESIGN </h2>

                    <P>
                        After creating the Lo-Fi wireframes i moved on to high fidelity based on the structure and
                        content I crafted through the ideation and development phase.

                    </P>

                    <h3> COLOURS</h3>

                    <p>
                        I decided to go with a bright, off-white colour (#69707E) for the main background to give it the
                        feel of looking at paper
                        and cream colour gradient (#FFF7ED to #FFECD4) for all tiles, buttons etc. Using this made
                        information more visible and profound and distinguishable
                        from the main background without being too dark for text and other things.
                        I used a dark cobalt colour (#2D3950) for icons, headers and tabs and an blue-grey (#69707E) for
                        text to seperate their heirarchy without deviating too far from
                        their colour schemes.
                        <br>


                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <h3> TYPOGRAPHY </h3>
                    <p>
                        I used the font AKIRA in the original draft for main headers and tabs. As I made changes to the
                        interface and structure as a whole, it didn't make sense to keep that font as it did not
                        synergize with the overall app structure.
                        I wanted a simple and elegant font to use for the entire project akin to Helvetica Neue.
                        <br>
                        After researching a variety of fonts i settled on Muli. Using bold and semi-bold for headers and
                        tabs and regular for all other text.
                    </p>

                <section id="section-5">

                    <h2> REFLECTION </h2>

                    <P>
                        I made many changes an compromises over the course of designing this app.
                    </P>

                    <h3> NAVIGATION </h3>

                    <P>
                        The navigation was originally a slide function with the daily summaries.
                    </P>

                    <img class="old-nav" src="images/ux/proc/old nav.png">

                    <p>
                        I studied the IOS design guidelines more clearly and found that the standard navigation would
                        work best and allowed for more flexibility and freedom to give users more informative data.
                    </p>


                    <h3> STRUCTURE </h3>

                    <img class="measurment-image-1" src="images/ux/proc/measurement image 1.png">

                    <p class="measurment-image-1-text"> Initially, I had made the same error as I had seen in many other
                        apps. Putting the visual focus on one section (activity).

                        If each sub-category to be equally informative and equally necessary, the visual hierarchy for
                        must be the same. I had to start from stratch with this in mind.


                    </p>


                    <p> Having charts atop each tab affords users immediate visual information on each sub category in
                        addition to the detailed text information. Flattening the information hierarchy
                        it gave more leeway for other functionalities on the dashboard.
                    </p>


                    <h3> DESIGN </h3>
                    <p>
                        The original design was, for lack of a better word, horrid. It didn't have a clear purpose
                        defined.
                        It was originally made soley for tracking eating.
                        <br>
                        I took a step back to rethink the entire purpose of the app, why I thought to design it and how
                        it
                        could be made useful. Through several changes and iterations, I arrived at the final design.

                    </p>
                    <br> <br>

                    <img class="changes" src="images/ux/proc/changes.png">


                    <h3> WHAT I LEANRED </h3>
                    <p>
                        Designing this app was a big perspective changer for me. It was originally a pet project I made
                        for my brother who struggles with eating and digestive issues, but even then the design was
                        terribly contrived. Through research, studying the IOS design guidelines and constant iteration,
                        I was able to make changes that made it more useful to a larger audience. I still believe there
                        could be more to do, different ways to make it better and easier for people to use.
