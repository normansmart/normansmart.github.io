                <h2> OVERVIEW</h2>
                <p> When dorming in college, myself and my roommates bickered quite a bit over how to manage our
                    responsibilities to our shared living space. I had the benefit of being good friends with all of
                    them but that didn’t stop us from having serious problems as roommates.
                    <br> <br>
                    I had seen and heard many different complaints and critiques from others about their rooming
                    experience and sought to figure a way to
                </p>
                </div>

                    <h2> PROBLEM STATEMENT </h2>

                    <p> The common problem many people I spoke too had with their roommates were incompatibility in
                        personality and behaviour
                        which cause severe gaps in communication. How can we help people find roommates that share much
                        of the same values
                        as the users while helping them maintain their responsibilities to one another?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So i thought to create a mobile app to help people find roommates with: <br> <br>

                        <b> Compatibility matching:</b> A questionnaire that matches people by personality. <br> <br>

                        <b> Home management: </b> Tracks house chores, rent payments etc, among all housemates.
                    </p>

                    <h2> RESEARCH </h2>
                    <h3> USER INTERVIEWS</h3>
                    <p> I conducted interviews and surveys with people I who had both finished college and moved out to
                        find roommates or were still in college living on campus. I spoke with 5 people who shared their
                        past and present experiences with both searching for and living with their roommates. 
                    </p>

                    <h3> SURVEYS</h3>
                    <p> I surveyed 15 additional people to gain more information on how users would like to find other
                        people.
                    </p>

                </section>

                    <h2> IDEATION </h2>
                    <h3> USER STORIES</h3>
                    <p> Using the information gathered from user interviews, surveys and other secondary information I
                        was able to determine the average user would be young adults, still in or recently graduated
                        college around the age range of 19 to 27 years old living in the suburbs and working in a city.
                        With this information I created 3 personas to identify potential users.
                    </p>




                    <img class="userstory" src="images/ux/bunkbud/userstories.png">



                    <h3> COMPATIBILITY MATCHING</h3>
                    <p> From the information gathered during the user research process I found that users believed
                        having a verified identity wasn’t enough to make them want to live with someone when looking for
                        roommates online. Nearly all the people interviewed mentioned they had problems with the
                        behaviours, attitudes and personalities of their roommates.
                    </p>

                    <img class="chart" src="images/ux/bunkbud/chart.png">

                    <p> The responses were distributed fairly evenly between preferences. The majority choosing to live
                        with people who share maintenance needs with them (chores, cleanliness, rent responsible etc).
                        Which makes sense given the most pressing concern for people who live together, whether they are
                        close to one another or not, is how they live together. 
                        <br><br>
                        Roommates being acquainted with a friend
                        of theirs was a close second. About 5% less of the majority cared more to match with people
                        their friends know and can vouch for, which suggests to me an understandable security concern.
                        And the last by personal interests such as hobbies.
                    </p>
                    <br> <br>
                    <p> With all the data I gathered from the overall research I concluded there needed to be a
                        compatibility element to the app. An interviewee actually suggested I try something akin to how
                        dating websites match people like okcupid or match. 
                        
                        I created a question-based algorithm in two
                        parts; the individuals' self and the individuals living standards. Users who have similar
                        wants/needs will see each other more so than those who don’t. </p>
                    <br>
                    <P> An interviewee suggested that I use a matching algorithm similar to that of dating sites. I
                        researched the compatibility questioning of different sites such as okcupid, match.com etc, and
                        crafted a series of questions to match users on what type of person they are and how they live.

                    <h2> DESIGN </h2>

                    <h3> COLOURS</h3>

                    <p>
                        Green is a cool, calming colour that represents life or energy. From that association it holds
                        meaning
                        in growth, harmony, safety, ambition etc. A green colour palette is fitting for an app that
                        promotes
                        growth and stability among people living together. I used a bright orange to contrast the green
                        for
                        certain indicators and added a great deal of white to contrast the darker text. I wanted to keep
                        the
                        overall app style simple and monotone so I stuck to one shade of the main green colour.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <h3> TYPOGRAPHY </h3>
                    <p>
                        SF Pro Text is a simple, modern apple font. It’s well balanced and seems to compliment the
                        interface. I
                        wanted to keep the design spec minimal while adhering to the IOS design guidelines, so I used SF
                        Pro
                        Text for the majority of the interface to maintain the monotony and SF Pro Display for font
                        sizes above
                        20pts, I mainly used them for headers.
                    </p>
