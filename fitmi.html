                    <p> Fitmi is a mobile social media application made to allow users to showcase their clothing and
                        fashion senses to share with others.
                        <br>
                        My good friend came to me to help him redesign this app. Upon review, I saw fit to overhaul the
                        entire design structure.

                        Create a social media application geared towards personal clothing and fashion styles of users

                    <h2> RESEARCH </h2>
                    <h3> THE AUDIENCE</h3>
                    <p> Fitmi is a social media application and as such, one can make assumptions about the key
                        demographics of the perceived user base. The nature of the app is much akin to Instagram because
                        of its fashion oriented aesthetic but also much like pinterest for information on clothing
                        detail. It is easy to assume there would be more women than men using this, but to what degree?
                        <br>
                        According to sproutsocial.com Social media demographics to inform your brand’s strategy in 2020,
                    </p>
                    <br> <br>

                    <div class="demographics-images">

                        <img src="images/ux/fitmi/facebook dem.png">

                        <img src="images/ux/fitmi/instagram dem.png">

                        <img src="images/ux/fitmi/pinterest dem.png">

                        <img src="images/ux/fitmi/snapchat dem.png">

                    </div>


                    <p> Instragram and Pinterest have considerably higher usage among women than men, but interestingly,
                        Pinterest has almost no usage among younger women below age 18 as opposed to Instagrams 13-17yrs
                        taking up the majority of the usage at 72%. Given the fashion heavy orientation of the app, it
                        is to be expected that the user base would be mainly women ranging from 15-20 years old and
                        slightly declining as the age range increases.
                        <br> <br>
                        Because there is an informative aspect to this app, users posts contain information about brands
                        and types of clothing they wear in their posts, I was not expecting there to be many men using
                        this app for its intended purpose given that Instagram gives the same effect without the effort
                        or interest towards the fashion and almost no men use Pinterest.

                    <h2> DEVELOPMENT </h2>
                    <P>
                        After researching and designating my desired user base, I began making changes to the original
                        design of the app.
                    </P>
                    <h3> CHANGES & COMPROMISES</h3>
                    <p>
                        The main contention I had with the feature my client wished to have in the app was a Tinder-like
                        “Yes / No” rating system for user posts.

                    </p>

                    <br> <br>
                    <p> <b>Original design: </b> </p>

                    <div class="previousimages">

                        <img src="images/ux/fitmi/Wickdly 4.jpg">

                        <img src="images/ux/fitmi/Wickdly 7.jpg">

                    </div>


                    <p>
                        I did not want to include any features that would support any negative reinforcement in using
                        the app. If users know how many people dislike the posts, it would disincentivize them from
                        using the app. Especially considering that the user base would be young women, there could be a
                        psychologically negative outcome with things such as self-esteem issues and such that do not
                        need to be placed on the user in case of bad feedback.

                        <br> <br>
                        Bullying is also another issue to consider. The possibility of the “Ratio” phenomenon, where a
                        significant number of users either like or dislike a person's content. A situation where a user
                        can get 5 likes but 15 dislikes could be a major setback towards the growth of Fitmi.
                        <br> <br>
                        Going with a simple like feature proved more valuable for this purpose.


                    </p>

                    <p> <b>Redesign: </b> </p>

                    </div>


                    <h3> FEATURES</h3>
                    <p> Fitmi is geared mainly towards clothing and fashion. So giving users freedom to express
                        themselves and discover other fashion senses was the core goal of the app. Key features
                        necessary to have would be to:
                        <br>
                        - Allow users to view information of the “outfits” posted
                        <br>
                        - Let users view a wide range of fashion styles and types
                        <br>
                        - Users can create their own fashion folder collections
                        <br>
                        - Save posts from other users
                        <br>
                        - Interactivity with other users through posts and private messaging
                        <br>
                        - Allows businesses, individual, small and large, to advertise their products through the app
                        <br>
                        - Dark mode
                        <br> <br>
                        I structured the app on these considerations
