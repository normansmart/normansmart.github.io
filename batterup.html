                    <p> Batter Up is a website concept I design for a good friend named Thomas Podschelne, who I had the
                        pleasure of meeting and working with at a grocery store. He was a skilled baker, and skilled is
                        an understatement. Thomas had a dream of opening his own bakery and I offered to design and make
                        him one. Unfortunately due to health concerns he took a leave of absence and soon after was
                        transferred to a different store.

                    <p> Create an ecommerce website that appeals to a variety of people, including a streamlined payment
                        process and developing an attractive visual aesthetic.

                    <h2> RESEARCH</h2>
                    <p> I studied the necessities of e-commerce business to see how i can formulate the structure of the
                        site.
                        Since itâ€™s a bakery, it was fairly simple from the get-go, but my goal was to make the
                        experience as easy and simple for the user.


                        <br>
                        The site would need to:
                        <br>
                        - Have a simple easy to use navigation structure
                        <br>
                        - Streamline menu and ordering into one
                        <br>
                        - Allow users to view the status of their orders
                        <br>
                        - A simple payment processing system
                        <br> <br>

                        I drafted the user tree and wireframe structure

                    <p class="measurment-image-1-text"> The original menu display featured each category with its
                        respective image and a further click away to view the page for those menu items. I later
                        found this to be unnecessary and scrapped the manu page altogether in place of an online
                        ordering page where users can just pick categories they want and choose from an immediate
                        list.

                    <p class="measurment-image-1-text"> Thomas Podschelne is a hard-working man, Iraq war veteran
                        and the humblest man you'll every come across. He had an unfortunate experience with a PTSD
                        relapse that and was declared missing for a time. When he was found, he went on leave for
                        some months and returned but was soon after trasnferred to a different store and I haven't
                        been in contact with him since.
                        <br>
                        Thomas, it has been the greatest honour working with you. I hope you one day persue your
                        dream of opening that bakery and I will be right there to help you as much as I can.
                        <br> <br>
                        Thank you for your service.
